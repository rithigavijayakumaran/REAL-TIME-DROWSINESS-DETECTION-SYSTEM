# REAL-TIME-DROWSINESS-DETECTION-SYSTEM
A drowsiness detection system using YOLO and PyTorch could revolutionize road safety by monitoring driver conditions in real time. This system works by using a camera to continuously photograph the driver's face and assess the driver's level of alertness. Using YOLO's object recognition capabilities, the system can accurately identify the driver's eyes and facial features and accurately analyze key metrics such as eyelid closure, head position, and blink frequency.
 YOLO is one of the most famous object detection algorithms due to its speed and accuracy. It achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in real-time. Its open source YOLO model can also handle detecting smaller objects and far away objects. 


Model Selection and adaptation:

   We have chosen YOLO as an object detection framework and PyTorch as a deep learning library and we have set up a camera feed to capture real-time images or video frames of the driver's face. We have utilized OpenCV to track the driver's face across frames, reducing computation and improving speed.

Training and testing:	
	The model is then trained and tested for the practical implementation. Its being fine tuned to increase its efficiency and accuracy in detecting and recognizing the drowsiness of the drivers precisely.
